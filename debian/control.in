Description: T+A stream player
 This stream player attempts to play any audio stream thrown at it. It plays
 internet streams and files in various formats. Based on GStreamer, this player
 is supports any format that GStreamer supports.
 .
 D-Bus is used to send basic audio playing instructions to the daemon---which
 source it should play, fast winding, stop, pause. Meta data about the played
 stream (e.g., ID3 tags) are sent to D-Bus so that other programs running in
 the system can make sense of them.
