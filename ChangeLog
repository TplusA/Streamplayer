2016-05-02  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.8 released.

	* D-Bus: Signals are emitted with stream ID to enable more robust
	  client code.

	* D-Bus: Emit de.tahifi.Streamplayer.Playback.NowPlaying() when the
	  stream is definitely playing, not sooner (before, the signal was
	  emitted when the stream was handed over to playbin).

	* Meta data handling: Clear all known meta data when new stream
	  definitely starts.

2016-03-14  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.7 released.

	* Queue: Reduce number of queued URLs from 4 to 2. This may introduce
	  problems with gapless playback.

2016-02-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* Playback: Streams with very long URLs (longer than 511 characters)
	  were not played at all because of too small buffers of fixed size.
	  There is no restriction on URL length anymore.

	* Playback: Fixed bug that may have caused playing a wrong stream or
	  random playback lockups on skip or explicit play commands.

	* Bug fix: Avoid log disruption by very long messages.

2016-02-09  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Skip to next track: The interface of D-Bus method
	  de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Next() had to be extended to support
	  proper skipping.

2015-12-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Playback: Seeking in streams over D-Bus.

	* D-Bus: Extend de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Clear() to enable
	  race-free skipping of streams.

	* D-Bus: Do not emit stream-stopped signal when skipping to next
	  stream in queue. This improves interoperability with DRCPD.

2015-11-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* Fix skip to next track: The interface of D-Bus method
	  de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Push() had to be extended to support
	  glitch-free skipping to next track while the player is in play mode.
	  This is used by drcpd to start a new stream while another one is
	  playing.

	* Logging: Fix duplicate logs in conjunction with systemd; use logged
	  assertions.

2015-08-25  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Fix handling of stream tags: The tags are sent around correctly
	  again so that drcpd can catch them and send them to the display.

	* Fix fast filling of internal queue: When inserting tracks into the
	  internal queue fast enough, the tracks inserted first got lost.

	* Fix changing tracks: Some tracks already stored in the interal queue
	  got lost each time the track was changed.

2015-08-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Increase chunk size for downloading network streams to avoid
	  stuttering audio and high CPU consumption for high data rate
	  streams.

	  This is an optimization for our current target system. The overhead
	  for individual network transfers is quite big there in terms of CPU
	  consumption, so reading streams in small chunks lead to high CPU
	  load and thus occasionally stuttering audio playback.

2015-07-13  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* Error handling and recovery improved in some situations.

	* Show version information in log, add --version option.

2015-06-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.9 released.

	* First release for testing.
