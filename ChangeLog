	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Increase chunk size for downloading network streams to avoid
	  stuttering audio and high CPU consumption for high data rate
	  streams.

	  This is an optimization for our current target system. The overhead
	  for individual network transfers is quite big there in terms of CPU
	  consumption, so reading streams in small chunks lead to high CPU
	  load and thus occasionally stuttering audio playback.
