2021-10-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.15 released.

	* Queue: Allow certain non-standard tags in preset tags so that
	  x-drcpd-title can be set by REST API or SPI slave, and sent to drcpd
	  when the stream starts playing.

2021-09-20  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.14 released.

	* Cover art: Send cover art URLs to TACAMan for download,
	  preprocessing, and sending to our remote control. These URLs are
	  usually passed in by REST API clients which send them as part of
	  preset meta data.

2021-08-27  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.13 released.

	* D-Bus: The de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Push() method takes preset
	  meta data which we can use as fallback in case the stream itself
	  doesn't contain any meta data.

2021-06-30  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.12 released.

	* Playback: Extend handling of strbo-usb to be useful with devices
	  which have no UUIDs. Requires MounTA v1.2 or later.

2021-06-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.11 released.

	* Playback: Support playing from USB partitions using the strbo-usb
	  URI scheme.

2021-05-04  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.10 released.

	* Playback: Fix leaving pause state during buffering phase.

2021-04-27  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.9 released.

	* Playback: Proper reaction to buffer underruns. In case of an
	  underrun, the stream is paused until the buffer is filled to 100%,
	  then unpaused. This avoids permanent stuttering in case we are
	  playing a little bit too fast or the server is a little bit too
	  slow.

	* D-Bus: Emit buffer level and buffering state over D-Bus.

	* Playback: We always use GStreamer's default buffer sizes now unless
	  something else is specified on the command line. No more magic
	  buffer setups, just clear and simple command line parameters.

2021-04-23  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.8 released.

	* Playback: ALSA latency set to 50 ms, other buffers are back to
	  GStreamer defaults. The buffers can still be manipulated from the
	  command line.

2021-04-16  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.7 released.

	* Playback: Add command line option for using GStreamer's default
	  buffers instead of our adjusted sizes.

2021-03-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.6 released.

	* Playback: Reduce buffer sizes again to make pause mode work as
	  expected.

	* Misc: Add command line options for adjusting buffer sizes.

2021-03-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.5 released.

	* Playback: Avoid stuttering while playing high-res streams on CM1 by
	  increasing buffer sizes. The buffers on the ALSA sink are too small
	  for the CM1, especially the latency of 10 ms was often not
	  sustainable on the CM1.

	  Not all stuttering can be avoided this way, but the situation has
	  improved a lot by this change.

	  Note that this change has no effect with older GStreamer versions as
	  those versions will not call the required callbacks and thus won't
	  allow us to adjust ALSA settings.

2021-02-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.4 released.

	* Playback: Fix error detection during gapless playback, and improve
	  error handling.

	* D-Bus: Fix de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Clear() implementation
	  which was operating on its very own, useless queue.

	* Misc: Use GLib RAII wrappers for GError and GLib strings to avoid
	  memory leaks.

	* Logging: Avoid flooding the log with messages telling that the
	  "beats-per-minute" tag is not known.

2020-11-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.3 released.

	* Playback: Fix communication of pause/play state. This information is
	  now cleanly separated from the now-playing signal.

	* Playback: Send signal when leaving pause state.

2020-10-28  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.2 released.

	* Streamer: Fix queue handling on start of stream.

	* Streamer: Fix handling of skipped streams.

	* Misc: Avoid a few compiler warnings.

2020-03-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.1 released.

	* Streamer: Fix handling of stream queue and meta data between track
	  changes.

2020-02-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 5.0 released.

	* Streamer: Report dropped stream IDs over D-Bus when the queue is
	  cleared. This change allows for better synchronization between
	  streamer player and player controller with much less guesswork
	  involved.

	* Streamer: Optimized tag handling for speed and improved
	  introspection.

	* Build system: Support Meson.

	* Licensing: Changed license from GPLv3+ to GPLv2+.

	* Misc: Many cleanups and modernizations.

2019-03-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.10 released.

	* Playback: Avoid null pointer dereferencing in MounTA signal handler.
	  It was possible to crash the player by just plugging in and pulling
	  out a USB pendrive.

2019-03-07  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.9 released.

	* Logging: Show buffer underrun conditions and filtered view on buffer
	  level while recovering from an underrun condition.

2019-02-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.8 released.

	* Playback: Stop playing if the current stream is stored on a USB
	  device which has been removed. MounTA v0.11 sends a corresponding
	  D-Bus signal.

2019-01-17  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.7 released.

	* Playback: Fix deadlock during playback.

2018-12-17  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.6 released.

	* Logging: Show the reason for stop commands to ease debugging of
	  problems related to unexpected playback stops.

	* Misc: Started porting to C++ to avoid killing velocity. There are
	  some problematic parts ahead, and they are going to be easier to
	  manage in C++.

2018-06-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.5 released.

	* Audio sources: Adapted to changed D-Bus interfaces required for
	  Roon certification.

2018-03-06  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.4 released.

	* Misc: Do not error out if markdown is not installed.

2017-11-27  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.3 released.

	* Performance: Improve seek performance by reducing accuracy.

2017-11-24  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.2 released.

	* Performance: Stuttering audio in conjunction with big cover art data
	  has been fixed.

2017-09-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.1 released.

	* Summary: This is a merge of versions 3.6 and 4.0. Since v4.0 was a
	  fork of v3.1, this version includes all the fixes and changes for
	  v3.2 through v3.6. No additional changes have been applied.

2017-08-31  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 3.6 released.

	* Playback: Fix automatic skipping of non-playable files (such a JPEG
	  pictures). This used to work up until version 3.3, but stopped
	  working in v3.4 as a result of the signal emission fixes added to
	  that version.

2017-06-08  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 3.5 released.

	* Playback: Fix deadlock on error recovery.

	* Playback: Fix playing from empty queue after error recovery.

2017-05-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 4.0 released.

	* Audio routing: Register with TAPSwitch as player.

	* Audio routing: The player will not play anything before being
	  activated as part of the currently configured audio path.

	* Misc: Asynchronous registration with dcpd (debugging stuff) for a
	  significant speed-up of program start.

2017-05-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 3.4 released.

	* Playback: Emission of stop signals and other signals is more
	  reliable now.

	* Playback: Report correct stream duration with PositionChanged
	  signals.

	* Playback: Report correct play state on push-to-queue. The previous
	  version caused a mess-up of dcpd's app mode after a list has
	  finished playing.

	* Meta data: Support extraction of tags that are naturally represented
	  as 64 bit unsigned integers. This also avoids warnings when
	  encountering such tags (most notably, the "duration" tag).

2017-04-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 3.3 released.

	* Playback: Support fast forward, fast reverse, and seeking. Seeking
	  has been supported before, but it was never used except for jumping
	  to the beginning to the stream.

	* Playback: Avoid emission of signals in cases where GStreamer reports
	  changes when there are none. This seriously confused the user
	  interface and caused a lot of trouble in the skipping mechanism.

	* Misc: Seek position can be given either as a percentage value, or as
	  an absolute time (s, ms, us, or ns).

	* Stability: Avoid rare crash.

2017-03-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 3.2 released.

	* Playback: Fix stopping stream. A signal was missing, causing the UI
	  to stay in play view even when the stream has really stopped.

	* Playback: Avoid sending now-playing notification twice on stream
	  start. Not only was this wasteful, but it also confused dcpd,
	  causing it to send the cover art hash to the SPI slave twice.

	* Misc: Fix crash.

2017-02-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 3.1 released.

	* Cover art: Extract image data from playing streams.

	* Cover art: Send images to cover art cache.

	* Playback: Fix resume from pause state. A signal was missing, causing
	  the UI to behave oddly.

	* Playback: Fix skipping in pause state.

	* Misc: Minor changes in logs.

2017-02-16  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 3.0 released: Changes of D-Bus interfaces were necessary
	  which break compatibility with older versions, hence the change of
	  the major version.

	* Cover art: Store stream key passed via extended push interface, emit
	  it via extended now-playing interface. There is nothing else the
	  stream player needs to do to get cover art handling supported.

2017-01-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 2.0 released.

	* Playback: GStreamer errors are handled properly. In case of error,
	  the reason for the error is sent over D-Bus. No automatic skipping
	  or restarting is done.

	* Playback: Added alternative ways to determine the total stream
	  duration. For some sources, the total time is sent as an internal
	  message while the stream is playing, for others the time is
	  available much sooner.

	* D-Bus: Use of the URL FIFO has changed a bit. Clients are supposed
	  to restart or skip to other streams on error depending on any
	  context hidden from streamplayer. This makes error handling a lot
	  more transparent and keeps streamplayer simple.

	* D-Bus: Some interface signatures have changed to support the new way
	  of client interaction. API compatibility with v1.9 was broken.

	* Debugging: Allow setting verbosity level over D-Bus.

2016-07-14  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.9 released.

	* Meta data handling: Meta data updates are less frequent and filtered
	  now. This avoids overloading the CPU for high data rate tracks
	  combined with frequent meta data updates, thus stuttering playback.

2016-05-02  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.8 released.

	* D-Bus: Signals are emitted with stream ID to enable more robust
	  client code.

	* D-Bus: Emit de.tahifi.Streamplayer.Playback.NowPlaying() when the
	  stream is definitely playing, not sooner (before, the signal was
	  emitted when the stream was handed over to playbin).

	* Meta data handling: Clear all known meta data when new stream
	  definitely starts.

2016-03-14  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.7 released.

	* Queue: Reduce number of queued URLs from 4 to 2. This may introduce
	  problems with gapless playback.

2016-02-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* Playback: Streams with very long URLs (longer than 511 characters)
	  were not played at all because of too small buffers of fixed size.
	  There is no restriction on URL length anymore.

	* Playback: Fixed bug that may have caused playing a wrong stream or
	  random playback lockups on skip or explicit play commands.

	* Bug fix: Avoid log disruption by very long messages.

2016-02-09  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Skip to next track: The interface of D-Bus method
	  de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Next() had to be extended to support
	  proper skipping.

2015-12-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Playback: Seeking in streams over D-Bus.

	* D-Bus: Extend de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Clear() to enable
	  race-free skipping of streams.

	* D-Bus: Do not emit stream-stopped signal when skipping to next
	  stream in queue. This improves interoperability with DRCPD.

2015-11-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* Fix skip to next track: The interface of D-Bus method
	  de.tahifi.Streamplayer.URLFIFO.Push() had to be extended to support
	  glitch-free skipping to next track while the player is in play mode.
	  This is used by drcpd to start a new stream while another one is
	  playing.

	* Logging: Fix duplicate logs in conjunction with systemd; use logged
	  assertions.

2015-08-25  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Fix handling of stream tags: The tags are sent around correctly
	  again so that drcpd can catch them and send them to the display.

	* Fix fast filling of internal queue: When inserting tracks into the
	  internal queue fast enough, the tracks inserted first got lost.

	* Fix changing tracks: Some tracks already stored in the interal queue
	  got lost each time the track was changed.

2015-08-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Increase chunk size for downloading network streams to avoid
	  stuttering audio and high CPU consumption for high data rate
	  streams.

	  This is an optimization for our current target system. The overhead
	  for individual network transfers is quite big there in terms of CPU
	  consumption, so reading streams in small chunks lead to high CPU
	  load and thus occasionally stuttering audio playback.

2015-07-13  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* Error handling and recovery improved in some situations.

	* Show version information in log, add --version option.

2015-06-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.9 released.

	* First release for testing.
